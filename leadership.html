The goal of this proposal is to seek funding from Brunswick Education Foundation to help purchase one iPad with the Apple Pencil for 
use in the art room at Walter Kidder Elementary School. There are approximately 450 students at Kidder that would benefit from having 
an iPad in the art room. The integration of an iPad would help students explore the elements and principals of art in ways they cannot 
do with traditional mediums. The students will be able to learn about layers with transparency, resizing and rotating objects for improving 
composition and using self-evaluation by easily undoing mistakes. Even though this grant is for only one iPad the goal is to demonstrate the 
benefits the technology brings to art students. The data collected will be used to write additional grants for additional iPads in the future. <br />

Every year I spend a week with the 5th grade at a camp called Hiram House. During the week students take many different classes. I developed a 
	class for the students called Nature Photography. This class uses digital cameras and photo editing software. The students learn the skills 
	nessesary to take high quality photographs and learn how to adjust them through the use of the editing software. I was able to write a grant
	through Brunswick Education Foundation to purchase the digital cameras and editing software. The use of the purchased equipment and software 
	is used through out the school year in all different grade levels. I have also shared my experiences with the other art teachers in the district 
	and have involved the Brunswick High School Photography teacher. <br />

  The link above is a review of the technology plan for Bloom-Carroll Local School District. The current technology plan (2017-2020) 
has been thoroughly reviewed and recommendations have been made to enhance the plan. These recommendations include: changes to the 
existing technology team, creating parent and teacher technology surveys to help collect data, addressing outdated technology, considering 
new budgetary needs and identifying specific technology for special education and encore teachers. Even though Bloom-Carrol Local Schools 
plan is very thorough a few additions will advance the district into the 21st century. The students and staff will benefit greatly from the 
implementation of this plan and help the students thrive as 21st century learners. <br />

This year I was chosen by my principal to head up the Art TBT Leadership team.The plan was to find a way for all the elementary art teachers to meet once a week
	to work on specific instructional goals for elementary art teachers. Each building starts at different times, due to bussing, and are not in close proximity 
	to one another. This program had to follow the districts TBT schedualing and policies. I formulated a plan to have all the teachers meet via Google Hangouts. 
	This allowed for all of us to meet face to face from our own classrooms. I work with the other teachers to develop programs to incorporate more writing in 
	the art curriculum and help collect data to drive instruction. I use Google docs to complete weekly notes on the meetings and so that each teacher can participate 
	in filling out the forms as we meet. In the past art teachers had to sit in with the general classroom teachers as they discussed their grade level curriculums. 
	It was determined this was not a good use of art teachers time.
