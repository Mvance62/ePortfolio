    My first Wiki website which was developed to reflect on my own teaching and learning in the beginning of my instructional technology journey. The reflections shown include various topics such as my personal use of technology in the classroom, ethics regarding technology in the classroom, and the impact of technology on learning. Due to "WikiSpaces" closing their website, I have since transferred the information to pbworks.com which is the link above.<br />

<td align="center" height="30"><font size="3"><a href="https://www.artsonia.com">Artsonia Website</a><br />
In my classroom I use this website as an online art portfolio for my students. The students will photograph their projects and then upload them into Artsonia using an Ipad. Once their projects are in the site the students will add artists statments and can do self-reflections and self-assessments<br />

<td align="center" height="30"><font size="3">Integrating Project and Paper<br />
  The project being implemented is a cross-curricular project that will involve language arts and art. This will be implemented with all three classes of 5th grade. In the art classroom the students will learn about the rise of graffiti in NYC in the 1970’s and 80’s. The main focus will be on having the students analyze the idea of whether graffiti is art or vandalism. They will be assessed on their understanding of graffiti and their creative ability in using various techniques in a design they create. The art portion of this lesson will be done first and then their new knowledge of graffiti will be used in the language arts lesson. <br />

<td align="center" height="30"><font size="3">Google Forms<br />
	One way that I collect data from my students is by using Google Forms. Google forms is a free web-based app that enables teachers to quickly and easily collect information from students. This can be for pre assessments, formative assessments or just to get feedback on a range of different topics. Since our district has gone to 1:1 with Chromebooks Google forms has made a huge impact on creating quality assessments for my students. The “Google Forms” link above takes you to an pre-assessment form that I use with my students. <br />

<td align="center" height="30"><font size="3">Online Learning Project<br />
  This Graffiti online learning project is designed to introduce the concept of graffiti to 5th grade students. The students will get a basic introduction to Graffiti in New York City in the 1980’s through an online lecture and a YouTube video. The main concept is to encourage the students to use critical thinking skills to analyze whether they think graffiti is vandalism or art. They will consider the impact graffiti has on New York City and the subway system. The students will then use this information to transition into an art-making lesson that identifies specific techniques used by graffiti artists. The students will watch a teacher led instructional video on the different techniques to designing a graffiti style name design. Once the student have an understanding of the requirements they will use a website to create an original name design using graffiti techniques. Once their artwork is done they will share it with the other students and participate in an online critique of each other’s work. The online component of this unit will be supported with in class instruction and a final hand drawn and colored graffiti design. The “Online Learning Project” link above will take you to a screen shot of my Google classroom. Due to the security measures of Google classroom I cannot add a link to my currently in use classroom.<br />
