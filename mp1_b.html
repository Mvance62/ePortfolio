<td width="530"><p> I grew up in South Euclid and went to Brush High School. Not only am I a teacher but I have been a firefighter for the Brunswick Hills Fire 
Department for the past 17 years. I teach about 450 students from Kindergarten to 5th grade. Teaching is my second career. I ran my own painting business for 
15 years before getting into teaching. I did my undergraduate at Bowling Green State University in the late 1980's and received my teaching licensure from 
Cleveland State University in 2008.  </p></td>
